Problem_1: 
Basic Caluclator 
Approch Followed is 
Created a class Called the Calculator and in that class added four 
Methods for different operations like Add/Sub/Multi/Div

And as Expected return type is Double methods Return types are Double. 

Problem_2:
Printing the Odd Numbers Based on the User Input 

"Means if the user input is n we have to print N Odd Numbers From 1"

Approch Followed is Intinalizing the Num variable to 1 because we have to start from the num 

and taking the Loop upto Number 'a' we needed to include that 'a' also so we use <= condition

and iterating over a loop and printing each element. 

Problem_3:
Printing the Odd Numbers Based on the User Input 

"Basically this code also same as the previous but small modification" 

which is when the user enters a even number then we have to print upto n-1 odd numbers only 

but when user enters a odd number then we have to print upto n odd numbers 

used conditonal statments for this and checks even or odd !

Problem_4: 

Get the total count of number listed in the dictionary which is multiple of

We are having the the array in that array of numbers and we have to find the multiple of 1-9 if multiple means count. 

Solved based on collections used HashMap which is used to store key-value pairs
